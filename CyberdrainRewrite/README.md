My blog post with more details can be found here https://mspp.io/cyberdrain-automatic-documentation-scripts-to-hudu/
Please make sure you update to the latest version of the HuduAPI Powershell module and at least version 2.1.5.3 of Hudu (The groups script won't work until 2.1.5.4 is released generally)

These are rewritten versions of the scripts originally written by Kelvin Tegelaar. I have tweaked them to work with Hudu instead of IT Glue.
The original scripts can be found at: https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/AutomaticDocumentation
I also recommend you check out Kelvins blog for more details on them https://www.cyberdrain.com/category/series-powershell-documenting/

<strong>Note:</strong> These scripts are intended as examples and you should convert them to work with your own RMM or toolset. Primarily, do not store any of your API Keys or tokens in the script itself and then leave them sitting on desktops or servers.
