These are rewritten versions of the scripts originally written by Kelvin Tegelaar. I have tweaked them to work with Hudu instead of IT Glue.
The original scripts can be found at: https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/AutomaticDocumentation
I also recommend you check out Kelvins blog for more details on them https://www.cyberdrain.com/category/series-powershell-documenting/
